# Local Azure DevOps agent


## Intro

This workshop will guide you into installing and running a local Azure DevOps agent that will enable running pipelines in Azure.

## Prerequisites

- Internet connection
- Azure subscription
- Windows/Mac machine (admin rights)
- Powershell version 7+ [Install Instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.2)
- Azure CLI [Azure CLI windows/macos](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- Open powershell as administrator and run 'az config set extension.use_dynamic_install=yes_without_prompt' to allow installing extensions without prompt. This configuration is needed so we could install the extension that will make the copy to azure blob storage for the website.

## Steps

## 0. Create new Organization !!!

Navigate and login with your account, or the provided one to http://dev.azure.com. If no organization exists then you'll be prompted to creaate one. Add the details and save it.

## 1. Agents pools

 Head over to azure devops and select your organization (example: https://dev.azure.com/[my-organization]/). On the bottom left there is configuration weell with the name: **Organization settings**, click on it. On the new window, find and click on the left side on the **Agent Pools**. You'll see 2 pools: Azure pipelines and Default. The Azure one, because no credit card was added to your account, will provide you no working agents. The **Default** is where you can add your own agents. Your own agents will have no limits and you'll be able to run pipelines and see the results.

 From the popup window, select your OS and follow the steps to download the agent binaries.

 Here is an windows os example:

Follow the steps provided using power shell, for windows, they should look like the ones below:

```ps
PS C:\> mkdir agent ; cd agent
PS C:\agent> Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ; [System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory("$HOME\Downloads\vsts-agent-win-x64-2.202.0.zip", "$PWD")
```

## 3. Personal Access Tokn

Having the files downloaded ready for configuration and run, next you'll have to generate a PAT (Personal Access Token) so that the local agent could connect to Azure and register for your organization.

Open in browser your devops organization url (https://dev.azure.com/[my-organization]) and on the top right click on **User Settings** on the right of your name icon, and select **Personal Access Tokens**. On the new window click on **+ New Token** and then on the form add a name, 90 days for expiration and select **Full Access**. Copy the newly created PAT in notepad because we'll need it in the next steps.

## 4. Configure and run the agent

With the agent files downloaded and PAT saved, configure your local agent using your organization details by running **./config.cmd** for windows inside PowerShell.

Use the following details:
- enter server url: your organization url. Ex: https://dev.azure.com/devschool2022
- PAT: your newly created PAT( the one from notepad & then delete it)
- agent pool: default (ENTER)
- agent name: default (Enter) - or a name
- work folder: default (ENTER)
- run agent as a service: N (we'll start it when needed )
- autologon : N

The result should be as in the following image:

Starting the agent is quite easy, in the same folder just run (windows version): 
```ps
./run
```

The result should be someting like this:
```ps
PS C:\agent> ./run
Scanning for tool capabilities.
Connecting to the server.

```


## 5. Azure Validation

Now, with the agent started head over to your Azure devops organization, click on **Organization settings** -> **Agent pools** -> **Default**-> **Agents** and you should see yout agent up and running as in the image below:

 One more thing, click on the agent name, then on top of the window on **Capabilities** and make sure you have the following value present **azureps** set to true. If is not there just add it using the **+** button.

 To stop the agent, just go to the window where it was started and `CTRL + C`, that will do the trick. To start the agent, just open power shell and navigate to the agent folder, then `./run` to start.
