 Click on the `+` sign to the right of the `Agent job 1` and on the right side search for `Node.js tool installer` and click on `Add`. Click on the new added item and on the right side set for `Version Spec`: `14.x`. You can also change the `Display name ` so it matches the same version `14.x`


![](imgs/3.cp-nodejs.png)

 Click on the `+` sign to the right of the `Agent job 1` and on the right side search for `npm` and click `Add`. Leave it default to install.

The website artifact should look something like the following:

**Well done!**

Next will set a trigger for our pipeline so that everytime a new commit to master will be done the pipeline will start automaticaly.

Congratulations! Now you have a new pipeline that will download the code for a single page application and will build it and the result will be published as an `Artifact`.
