# Local Azure DevOps agent

<br>


## Intro

This workshop will guide you into installing and running a local Azure DevOps agent that will enable running Azure build/release pipelines.
 
<br>

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription
- Virtual box [Download link](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 [Download link](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04.4)

<br>

### Duration: 10' - 15'

<br>

## Steps

<br>

## Install Ubuntu inside Virtual Box

<br>


Open Virtual Box and install Ubuntu 20.4 with `Minimal installation`. Make sure the disk has about 12GB of storage.  [Download link](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04.4)

Install `curl` for downloading the cli code. Open Terminal and run:


```
sudo apt install curl
```
<br>

Install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux?pivots=apt) 

```
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
```

<br>

Run the following command in the default Terminal:

```
az config set extension.use_dynamic_install=yes_without_prompt
```

<br>

Install `git` by executing the following command in the terminal:

```
sudo apt install git

```

<br>

After the above updates, your Ubuntu VirtualBox image will be ready to run Azure Pipelines.

<br>


## Create new Organization !

<br>

Navigate and login with your account, or the provided one to http://dev.azure.com. If no organization exists then you'll be prompted to create one. Add the details and save it.

<br>

## Agents pools

<br>

 Head over to azure devops and select your organization (example: https://dev.azure.com/[my-organization]/). On the bottom left there is configuration wheel with the name: **Organization settings**, click on it. 
 
<br>

 ![Agent Pools](imgs/agent-wheel.png 'Agent pools')

<br>
 On the new window, find and click on the left side on the  **Agent Pools** . You'll see 2 pools: Azure pipelines and Default. The Azure one, because no credit card was added to your account, will provide you no working agents. The **Default** is where you can add your own agents. Your own agent will have no limits and you'll be able to run pipelines and see the results.

<br>

<br>

 ## Downloading the client

<br>

 Click on the **Default** and then from the top right click on **New Agent**

<br>

<br>

 From the popup window, select your OS and follow the steps to download the agent binaries.

 Here is a Linux example:

<br>


 ![Agent Pools](imgs/agent-download.png 'Agent pools')

<br>


Follow the steps provided inside the Terminal app, they should look like the ones below:

```cmd
mkdir myagent && cd myagent
tar zxvf ~/Downloads/vsts-agent-linux-x64-2.202.1.tar.gz

```

<br>


##  Personal Access Tokn

<br>


Having the files downloaded ready for configuration and run, you'll have to generate a PAT (Personal Access Token) so that the local agent could connect to Azure and register for your organization.

Open in browser your devops organization url (https://dev.azure.com/[my-organization]) and on the top right click on **User Settings** to the right of your name icon, and select **Personal Access Tokens**. 

<br>

<br>

On the new window click on **+ New Token** and then on the form add a name, 90 days for expiration and select **Full Access**. Copy the newly created PAT in notepad because we'll need it in the next steps.

<br>

<br>

## Configure and run the agent

<br>


With the agent files downloaded and PAT saved, configure your local agent using your organization details by running **./config.sh** for inside the Terminal.

Use the following details:
- enter server url: your organization url. ( Ex: https://dev.azure.com/devschool2022 )
- PAT: your newly created PAT( the one from notepad & then delete it)
- agent pool: default (ENTER)
- agent name: default (Enter) - or a name
- work folder: default (ENTER)
- run agent as a service: N (we'll start it when needed )
- autologon : N

The result should be as the one in the following image:

<br>

 ![Agent Configured](imgs/agent-install.png 'Agent pools')

<br>

Starting the agent is quite easy, in the same folder just run: 

```cmd
./run.sh
```

<br>

The result should be someting like this:
```ps
 ./run.sh
Scanning for tool capabilities.
Connecting to the server.

```

<br>

##  Azure Validation

<br>


Now, with the agent started, head over to your Azure devops organization, click on **Organization settings** -> **Agent pools** -> **Default**-> **Agents** and you should see your agent up and running as in the image below:

<br>

 ![Agent Configured](imgs/agent-agent-created.PNG 'Agent pools')

<br>

<!-- 
 One more thing, click on the agent name, then on top of the window on **Capabilities** and make sure you have the following value present **azureps** set to true. If is not there just add it using the **+** button.

 To stop the agent, just go to the Terminal window where it was started and `CTRL + C`, that will do the trick. To start the agent, just open the Terminal and navigate to the agent folder, then `./run` to start.
