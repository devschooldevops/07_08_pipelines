**Well done!**

Next will set a trigger for our pipeline so that everytime a new commit to master will be made the pipeline will start automaticaly.

<br>

Open the **Pipelines** menu on the left side and select your new pipeline. Click on the **Edit** button and then on the **Triggers** tab. On the opened page, click on the **Enable continuous integration** then **Save & queue** your changes. Now, every time a change will be made to the original sources the build pipeline will be triggered.
