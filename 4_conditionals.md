# Conditionals

Most commonly, Azure DevOps offers the "condition:" and "dependsOn:" statement in jobs, stages and tasks.

The condition needs to be met in order for the instructions below to be run, and in case of dependency, this controls if a previous task has the desired outcome, then the block will run.

> The order in which those statements are evaluated if both present is condition and after dependsOn!
